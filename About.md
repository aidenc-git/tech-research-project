# About Me
Hi! My name is Aiden Christian, and I’m a high school student passionate about **computer engineering, cybersecurity, and physics**. I enjoy exploring how things work—both in software and hardware—and I love tackling projects that challenge me to think critically and approach problems like an engineer.  

Outside of academics, I’m active in **lacrosse**, which has taught me teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking—skills that I apply to engineering and software development. I also enjoy hands-on mechanical projects, taking things apart, improving them, and learning from the process.

## What I Hope to Learn
Through this Polygence mentorship, I hope to:  
1. **Master professional development workflows** – including Git/GitHub best practices, clean commit history, branching strategies, and pull requests.  
2. **Explore system architecture concepts** – experimenting with Docker, containerized environments, and how different components interact in a larger system.  
3. **Improve problem-solving skills** – developing an engineer’s mindset focused on scalability, efficiency, and structured thinking.  
4. **Build a meaningful project** – combining coding, engineering, and creative thinking in a way that mirrors real-world development standards.  
5. **Document my journey** – keeping track of what I learn, the challenges I face, and how I overcome them.

## Goals for This Repository
This repository will serve as:  
- A **learning log** documenting my progress and reflections  
- A **sandbox** for experiments in software development and system architecture  
- A space to **practice professional workflows** used by engineers in real-world projects
